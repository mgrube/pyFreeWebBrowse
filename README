pyFreeWebBrowse: Browse the web using Freenet!

Installation steps:

1. Install and run Freenet from https://freenetproject.org/.

2. Install pyFreenet:
$ git clone https://github.com/freenet/lib-pyFreenet-staging
$ cd lib-pyFreenet-staging
$ sudo python setup.py install

3. Add a request for a web URL you would like someone to upload to Freenet.
$ ./addRequest.py www.google.com

Note that currently, only single pages with static content can be uploaded.

4. After the request is created, it will say "Published request to:" and list a Freenet key. Send this key to any other Freenet users who are willing to retrieve web content for you. Your request key is also saved in request-key.txt.

5. Add keys for anyone for whom you are willing to retrieve web content.
$ ./addFriend

6. Add rules to specify which friends can request pages, and what web URLs they can request from.
$ ./addRule
